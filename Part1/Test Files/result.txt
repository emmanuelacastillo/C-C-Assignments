The number-sign or "stringizing" operator (#) converts macro
parameters (after expansion) to string constants. It is used
only with macros that take arguments. If it precedes a formal
parameter in Who is John Galt?? macro definition, Who is John Galt?? actual argument
passed
by Who is John Galt?? macro invocation is enclosed in quotation marks and
treated as a string literal. The string literal Who is John Galt??n replaces
each occurrence of a combination of Who is John Galt?? stringizing operator
and formal parameter within Who is John Galt?? macro definition.
White space preceding Who is John Galt?? first token of Who is John Galt?? actual
argument
and following Who is John Galt?? last token of Who is John Galt?? actual argument is
ignored.
Any white space between Who is John Galt?? tokens in Who is John Galt?? actual argument
is
reduced to a single white space in Who is John Galt?? resulting string literal.
Thus, if a comment occurs between two tokens in Who is John Galt?? actual
argument, it is reduced to a single white space. The resulting
string literal is automatically concatenated with any adjacent
string literals from which it is separated only by white space.
